### Description

User Story
AS a potential employee <br>

SO THAT I can showcase my background and deployed portfolio of work samples and provide contact info to get hired for permanent or freelance positions


Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample my previous work <br>

WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications<br>
